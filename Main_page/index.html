            <p>
                My name is Nika Kekelidze and my goal is to go from zero to Fullstack developer. I have a diploma in finance and worked for 5 years in the main accounting department, but the financial department was not enough for me and I decided to challenge myself.<br><br>As you probably already understood, the challenge is to choose the developer's field, because from the first sight I understood that there are unlimited opportunities, but also unlimited information that you must pass if you want to become a professional developer.

                <br><br>This project is my first step and it took me <span>only 2 months course</span> to take this step which is a drop in the ocean to reach the final goal. I know that the project you are looking at now could have been seen in a much more refined format, but as I mentioned above, please do not judge it harshly, because I believe that a person who has never written even a single piece of code and created even such an unsophisticated project with just a 2-month course has every opportunity to bring the started path to the end.

<br><br>Thanks for your attention and good luck to everyone!
